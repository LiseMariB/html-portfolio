<H1>Lise's Favourite Movies</H1>
<H2>My top 3 movies:</H2>
<hr />

<H3>The Holiday</H3>
<p>This is my favourite Christmas movie! It has feel good romance, character development and laugh out loud moments. <br /> A definite must see for romance lovers!</p>

<H3>The Twilight Saga</H3>
<p> I know, I know! YUCK! <br /> The truth is, hastag sorry not sorry! There is something very calming about the predictability and poor storyline of the twilight movies. Plus, who doesn't love a bit of shiny vampire action?</p>

<H3>The Lord of the Rings series</H3>
<p>Excellent acting. Excellent effects. Excellent storyline. <br /> All round one of the best stories written and filmed. Thank you J.R.R Tolkien for this masterpiece that is part of my top 3 best movies of all time. </p>
