<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lise and I am a South African woman living in Schoorl, North Holland. I moved to the Netherlands with my husband in March of 2021 during the peak of Covid. Both our families still live in South Africa. We speak Afrikaans, English and Dutch. </p>

<p>I have been a teacher for 12 years and seeking change, have started learning how to code. My dream is to work in the corporate world and be a programmer or a UX-designer. As I consider myself to be a creative person I think I might enjoy working on front-end more than back-end. My husband is a fullstack developer and I thus have the advantage of asking him for help whenever I get stuck.</p>

<p>Currently all my time is used persuing these new programming skills. I am hopeful that I will be able to achieve my goals, and if not I am eager to find something else.</p>
